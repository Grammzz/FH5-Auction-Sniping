# FH5-Auction-Sniping
This is my very good FH5 auction sniping script. The exe without 1080p is for 1440p monitors. The one with 1080p in the name is probably for 1080p monitors.
To use this script, have python 3 installed, setup your auction sniping filters in FH5 then run this script. It will then go into action and buy cars using
the filters you setup. In order to kill the script, flick your mouse cursor to the corner of your monitor.
